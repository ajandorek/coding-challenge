# MKT Code Sample

Please find my code sample in this repo. I created mini-cards for each course that list all the relevant information from the API. I tried to model them after the ones I saw on the Aceable product page (with some minor tweaks) using a combination of Bootstrap and custom CSS. My goal, was to create the framework for a reusable component that would dynamically render new courses as they are added.

I decided to use the pre-made template provide, so to run the app simply download the repo and open this `index.html` file.

Please let me know if you have any questions!
